# Building a Comprehensive Data Analysis Report

## Objective

This capstone project is an great opportunity to demonstrate and apply the full range of skills and techniques acquired from the eight courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. Through this project, we will work with real-world datasets to create a comprehensive data analysis report.

Key tasks include data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visualization. Additionally, we will design interactive dashboards that bring our findings to life. The project focuses on analyzing trends in current technology usage, exploring future technology preferences, and uncovering valuable demographic insights. This is our chance to turn our learning into action and showcase the power of data storytelling.

## Dataset

We use datasets from various reliable sources:

- **Survey Data**: Infomation on current technology usage, future technology trends, and demographics were sourced from the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/HLOosvsPgIwt5dgOOh1RSg/survey-data-updated.csv).  
- **Job Posting Data**: Information on industry demand, job locations, and experience levels was gathered from the provided [webpage](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%201/Accessing%20Data%20Using%20APIs/jobs.json).  
- **Web-Based Data**: Details about popular programming languages and their average annual salaries were collected from the specified [website](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/Programming_Languages.html).  

## Dashboard

Our interactive dashboard, built using Google Looker Studio, provides an engaging way to explore our findings.
